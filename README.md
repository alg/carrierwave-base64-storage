Carrierwave Base64 Storage
==========================

This is the storage for Carrierwave that serializes the file and saves it into
the field the uploader was mounted on.


Installation
------------

    gem 'carrierwave-base64-storage'


Usage
-----

In your uploader specify the storage:

    class AvatarUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base
      storage :base64
    end

When you mount the uploader on a `field`, it uses `field_data` attribute
on the model to store the actual data, and so make sure the field exists
in your storage.

Example for the active record:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      mount_uploader :avatar, AvatarUploader
    end

(Will be using `avatar_data` for the actual data and the content type.)
